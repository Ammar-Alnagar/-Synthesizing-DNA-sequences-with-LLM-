# Synthesizing DNA Sequences with LLM

Welcome to the Synthesizing DNA Sequences with LLM repository! üß¨‚ú® This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and synthesize DNA sequences for various applications in genomics and synthetic biology.

## üìú Overview

The Synthesizing DNA Sequences with LLM project explores the use of advanced language models to create DNA sequences that meet specific criteria. By integrating LLMs with genomic data, this project aims to provide a powerful tool for generating synthetic DNA sequences with desired properties.

## üöÄ Features

- **DNA Sequence Generation:** Generate DNA sequences based on input parameters or desired properties.
- **Integration with LLMs:** Utilize large language models to predict and synthesize sequences effectively.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Specify various parameters to tailor the generated DNA sequences to specific needs.
- **Data Integration:** Incorporate genomic data to enhance the relevance and accuracy of generated sequences.
- **Evaluation Tools:** Assess the quality and suitability of synthesized DNA sequences.
